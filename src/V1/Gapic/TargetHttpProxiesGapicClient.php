     *           utilize the `$apiEndpoint` option instead.
     *     @type string $apiEndpoint
     *           The address of the API remote host. May optionally include the port, formatted
     *           as "<uri>:<port>". Default 'compute.googleapis.com:443'.
     *     @type string|array|FetchAuthTokenInterface|CredentialsWrapper $credentials
     *           The credentials to be used by the client to authorize API calls. This option

     *     @type array $credentialsConfig
     *           Options used to configure credentials, including auth token caching, for the client.

     *     @type string|array $clientConfig
     *           Client method configuration, including retry settings. This option can be either a
     *           path to a JSON file, or a PHP array containing the decoded JSON data.
     *           By default this settings points to the default client config file, which is provided
     *           in the resources folder.

     *           The transport used for executing network requests. At the moment, only supports
     *           `rest`.

     *                             Optional.
     *
     *     @type string $filter
     *          A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, or `<`.
     *
     *          For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`.
     *
     *          You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.
     *
     *          To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ```
     *     @type bool $includeAllScopes
     *          Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region, global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found will be included.
     *     @type int $maxResults
     *          The maximum number of resources contained in the underlying API
     *          response. The API may return fewer values in a page, even if
     *          there are additional values to be retrieved.
     *     @type string $orderBy
     *          Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.
     *
     *          You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.
     *
     *          Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
     *     @type string $pageToken
     *          A page token is used to specify a page of values to be returned.
     *          If no page token is specified (the default), the first page
     *          of values will be returned. Any page token used here must have
     *          been generated by a previous call to the API.
     *     @type bool $returnPartialSuccess
     *          Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false and the logic is the same as today.
     *     @type RetrySettings|array $retrySettings
     *          Retry settings to use for this call. Can be a
     *          {@see Google\ApiCore\RetrySettings} object, or an associative array
     *          of retry settings parameters. See the documentation on

     * @param string $project      Project ID for this request.

     *                             Optional.
     *
     *     @type string $filter
     *          A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, or `<`.
     *
     *          For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`.
     *
     *          You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.
     *
     *          To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ```
     *     @type int $maxResults
     *          The maximum number of resources contained in the underlying API
     *          response. The API may return fewer values in a page, even if
     *          there are additional values to be retrieved.
     *     @type string $orderBy
     *          Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.
     *
     *          You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.
     *
     *          Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
     *     @type string $pageToken
     *          A page token is used to specify a page of values to be returned.
     *          If no page token is specified (the default), the first page
     *          of values will be returned. Any page token used here must have
     *          been generated by a previous call to the API.
     *     @type bool $returnPartialSuccess
     *          Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false and the logic is the same as today.
     *     @type RetrySettings|array $retrySettings
     *          Retry settings to use for this call. Can be a
     *          {@see Google\ApiCore\RetrySettings} object, or an associative array
     *          of retry settings parameters. See the documentation on
     *          {@see Google\ApiCore\RetrySettings} for example usage.
